# ID2222 Data Mining

## Project 1: Finding Similar Items: Textually Similar Documents

Implement the stages of finding textually similar documents based on Jaccard similarity using the shingling, minhashing, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques and corresponding algorithms.

## Project 2: Discovery of Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules

Implement A-priori algorithm to find frequent itemsets with a given support threshold. Then generate association rules with a given confidence threshold from the itemsets found in the previous step.

## Project 3: Mining Data Streams

Implement the graph data stream algorithm based on the reservoir sampling algorithm in paper: L. De Stefani, A. Epasto, M. Riondato, and E. Upfal, TRIÃˆST: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully-Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size, KDD'16.

## Project 4: K-way Graph Partitioning Using JaBeJa

Implement JA-BE-JA algorithm based on papers: [F. Rahimian, et al., JA-BE-JA: A Distributed Algorithm for Balanced Graph Partitioning, SASO2013] and [F Rahimian et al., A distributed algorithm for large-scale graph partitioning, ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS) 10 (2), 12].
